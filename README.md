The second Frontend Mentor Project!

This project was completed on the 17th of May 2025. After an extended break period of 3 months, over the course of a week the entire project was completed. Various roadblocks, primarily confusion utilizing semantic html and the over-complication of code were encountered but overcome. The code for both html and css files, however had to be manually added due to issues with git bash.
